About this fork,
"ptable":
===============
This is a low effort fork of the super handy "PTable" library by Kane Blueriver
( https://github.com/kxxoling ). This fork is meant to simply address the capitalization
of the library name "PTable", changing it to "ptable" in order to be more pythonic.
I became interested in this issue after trying to build packages for other projects
which depend on this package.

This issue is described in the original project here:
https://github.com/kxxoling/PTable/issues/13

Also trying to test repackaging for pypi:
https://test.pypi.org/project/ptable/
ptable 0.9.2

To install this fork of "PTable", "ptable":
'pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ptable'
